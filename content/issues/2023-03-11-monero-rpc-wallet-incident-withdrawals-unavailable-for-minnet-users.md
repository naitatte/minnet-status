<!--StartFragment-->Our mining pool has recently experienced an incident with the Monero RPC wallet, which has prevented our users from being able to withdraw their earnings. The issue appears to be related to the payment processor code that was written by a third-party developer. Upon closer examination, we have discovered that the code for the payment processor is badly written and has led to a critical error in the RPC wallet

As a result, the RPC wallet is unable to process withdrawals for our mining pool users, causing a significant disruption in our services. We have been working diligently to fix the issue and have identified the root cause of the problem. Our development team is now working to correct the code in the payment processor to ensure that it functions as intended and that our users can once again withdraw their earnings.

We understand that this incident has caused inconvenience and frustration for our users, and we apologize for the disruption in our services. We are committed to resolving the issue as quickly as possible and ensuring that our mining pool continues to operate smoothly and efficiently. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this incident.<!--EndFragment-->
